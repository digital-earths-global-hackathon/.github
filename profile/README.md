# WCRP Global KM scale hackathon

The Digital Earths Global Hackathon will bring together scientists from around the world to jointly analyze the first ever coordinated experiments of 6 - 8 climate models simulating a full annual cycle with horizontal grid spacings of 5 km or less based on a common protocol ([Takasuka, D. et al. (2024)]( https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-024-00668-1)).

Participants will gather at one of a number of regional nodes for the hacking, each of which will provide access to a combined data-compute resource hosting the data and proximate computing capbility for its analysis. Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid. Standardization will help participants share their analysis workflows with other teams analyzing other models at other nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests.
